# Application boilerplate
As so many before me - I needed a boilerplate for applications

## Required technologies
For ES5 compabitility I have chosen WebPack as the builder with Babel on top for the fallback.

The Application itself is based on Backbone.js for the MC part of MVC, and React for the V.

Here listed some of the core techs used, for a full list look in the [package.json](https://github.com/IgorSzyporyn/WebMapApp/blob/master/package.json) file for all thats needs to be installed via npm.

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)

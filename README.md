# WebMap Application for World War II Online
An all out warfare MMOG deserves a top of the line cross platform application to properly present its full interactivity in all it's might and magic. As well as it's full extent and deep rich gameplay.

## Required technologies
For ES5 compabitility I have chosen WebPack as the builder with Babel on top for the fallback.

The Application itself is based on Backbone.js for the MC part of MVC, and React for the V.

Here listed some of the core techs used, for a full list look in the [package.json](https://github.com/IgorSzyporyn/WebMapApp/blob/master/package.json) file for all thats needs to be installed via npm.

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
